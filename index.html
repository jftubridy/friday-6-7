<!-- Include a minimum of 5 survey questions.
Offer a minimum of 3 different language suggestions.
Don't forget regular Git commits and a detailed README. Commit messages should always be on-topic and professional in tone.
Note: You are not required to take every possible combination of answers into account. Feel free to use very simple logic, or even ignore the user's responses for some questions as long as you show some good functionality and offer a minimum of 3 languages. It is also not required to publish your project to GitHub pages, but you may do so if you wish. -->
