<!-- Include a minimum of 5 survey questions.
Offer a minimum of 3 different language suggestions.
Don't forget regular Git commits and a detailed README. Commit messages should always be on-topic and professional in tone.
Note: You are not required to take every possible combination of answers into account. Feel free to use very simple logic, or even ignore the user's responses for some questions as long as you show some good functionality and offer a minimum of 3 languages. It is also not required to publish your project to GitHub pages, but you may do so if you wish. -->

<!-- Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

All previous standards (last week's objectives) are in place (see below).
Site uses branching to return the result.
jQuery is used to show and hide the result after questions are answered and submitted. (Tip: test your app several times with different answers.)
Form gathers input from the user.
Variable names are descriptive of what they represent.
Web page is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
The project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
Required functionality is in place by the Friday deadline.
Project demonstrates understanding of concepts covered this week. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.
Previous Objectives
For reference, here are last week's objectives:

Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦".
Project README that includes, bare minimum:
author name
program name
detailed setup instructions
description
copyright and license information -->
